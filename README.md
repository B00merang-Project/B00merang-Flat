# B00merang Flat
Experimental theme structure for a SASS-based GTK theme

B00merang Flat is a simple (and flat!) GTK theme for Gnome 3.20 or higher. It sports a dark titlebar and sidebar, slighlty rounded buttons and entries and a completely tweakable color palette. You simply have to edit the colors the theme uses and it will almost certainly render it right!

**Requirements**
- GTK 3.20 or higher
- Gnome Shell 3.20 or higher
- Pixbuf GTK 2 rendering engine
- Murrine GTK 2 rendering engine
